        <h2><u>Type casting</u></h2>
        <p>Converting from one type to another type is called <a href="www.type casting in java.n" target="_balnk">type casting</a>.</p>
        <ul>Their are two types of type castng :
            <li><u>Implicite type casting</u></li>
            <p>Complier is responsible to perform type casting <br>When ever we are assigning a smaller value to a bigger datatype variable implicite type casting automatically perform <br>It is also known as upcasting and widening</p>
            <pre>
                double d=10;
                System.out.println(d);
            </pre>
            <li><u>Explicite type casting</u></li>
            <p>Programmer is responsible to perform explicite typr casting.<br>When ver we are assgning  a bigger data value to a smaller datatype variable explicite type costng will be occur.<br>it is also known as down casting or narrowing. Their may be some loss of information.</p>
        </ul>
        <pre>
            int x=10;
            byte b=(byte)x;
            System.out.println(b);
